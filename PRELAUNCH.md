# TELODOX Pre-Launch Marketing Strategy

## Overview
We're implementing a pre-launch email capture system to build buzz and collect interested users before the August 1, 2025 launch date. This allows us to start marketing immediately while development continues, ensuring a strong user base ready to onboard on day one.

## Launch Strategy
- **Official Launch Date**: August 1, 2025
- **Pre-Launch Phase**: Now through July 2025
- **Goal**: Capture 500+ qualified email addresses before launch
- **Target**: 100+ signups on launch day from pre-registered users

## Technical Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 006)
Create a new table to store pre-launch email addresses:

```sql
-- Email waitlist for pre-launch marketing
CREATE TABLE email_waitlist (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    source VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- 'homepage', 'signup_redirect', 'manual'
    referrer TEXT, -- HTTP referrer for tracking
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}', -- Additional tracking data
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    subscribed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    notified_at TIMESTAMPTZ, -- When launch notification was sent
    converted_at TIMESTAMPTZ, -- When they actually signed up
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'unsubscribed', 'bounced', 'converted')),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_email_waitlist_email ON email_waitlist(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_waitlist_source ON email_waitlist(source);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_waitlist_status ON email_waitlist(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_waitlist_subscribed_at ON email_waitlist(subscribed_at);
```

### 2. New Routes & Pages
- `/early-access` - Main email capture page (redirect destination)
- `/api/early-access` - API endpoint to handle email submissions
- Update homepage with launch date section

### 3. Email Capture Flow
1. User clicks existing "Sign Up" or "Get Started" buttons
2. Redirect to `/early-access` page with clean messaging
3. Capture email with launch date expectations
4. Store in `email_waitlist` table with source tracking
5. Show success message with next steps

### 4. Homepage Updates
Add a prominent section with:
- Launch date announcement
- Value proposition reminder
- Email capture form
- Social proof elements (when available)

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Manual URL access for development testing
- Separate test environment variables
- Email validation and duplicate handling
- Analytics tracking for conversion optimization
