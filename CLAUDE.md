# TeloDox 

## Project Overview
Next-generation multi-tenant SaaS platform that transforms telecom carrier onboarding from email chaos into streamlined deal flow. Beyond simple document management, TeloDox delivers team collaboration, intelligent document processing, and MSA negotiation tools that accelerate deal cycles and increase win rates.

**Market Position**: The first platform built specifically for telecommunications that combines document automation, team workflow management, and collaborative MSA redlining in one integrated solution.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + PrimeVue
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **Email**: Amazon SES
- **Payments**: Stripe (subscription billing)
- **Serverless**: Cloudflare Workers/Edge functions

## Architecture
**Multi-tenant**: Each telecom company gets subdomain (e.g., `faketelecom.telodox.com`)
**Database**: Shared tables with Row Level Security using `tenant_id`
**Forms**: Sequential workflow (KYC ‚Üí FUSF ‚Üí MSA ‚Üí Interop) with owner approval gates

## User Roles

### Platform Level
1. **Super Admin**: Platform management and oversight

### Organization Level (within each tenant - e.g., GloTell)
2. **Organization Owner**: Ultimate authority with complete control
   - **User Management**: Add/remove multiple admins and team members
   - **Billing Management**: Subscription and payment oversight
   - **Form Templates**: Create and edit all form templates
   - **Complete Access**: Inherits ALL admin and team member capabilities
   - **Document Authority**: Sign documents, approve redlines, download all docs
   - **Visibility**: See all deals, all team activity, all carrier interactions

3. **Admin**: Senior staff with broad authority (multiple admins allowed)
   - **Redlining**: Redline MSAs and approve carrier redlines
   - **Communications**: Send notifications to anyone (carriers, team members)
   - **Team Building**: Add team members (not other admins)
   - **Document Authority**: Sign documents on behalf of organization
   - **Full Visibility**: Download ALL carrier documents, see ALL team member deals
   - **Approval Power**: Approve carrier redlines to allow process progression

4. **Team Member**: Individual contributors with focused responsibilities
   - **Limited Communications**: Send notifications to assigned carriers only
   - **Assigned Visibility**: View only assigned carriers' statuses and documents
   - **Document Access**: Download only assigned carriers' documents
   - **No Signing Authority**: Cannot sign documents or approve redlines

### External Level (Carriers applying for interconnection)
5. **Carrier**: External carrier companies with time-limited access
   - **Registration**: Signs up on tenant subdomain (e.g., `abc-telecom.com` ‚Üí `glotell.telodox.com`)
   - **Document Management**: Fill document information and sign agreements
   - **Redlining Capability**: Redline MSAs and approve organization redlines
   - **Mutual Consent**: Must approve organization redlines before process continues
   - **Limited Visibility**: Only their own application and documents
   - **Workflow Progression**: Complete KYC ‚Üí FUSF ‚Üí MSA ‚Üí Interop (with admin approval)
   - **Document Access**: Download only their own documents after completion
   - **Lifecycle**: Account archived/removed after process completion (90-day retention)

## Critical Business Logic & Edge Cases

### Mutual Redline Approval Workflow
**Intuitive Consent Process:**
- Either Carrier or Admin can initiate redlines on MSA documents
- Each redline creates a "change request" requiring explicit approval
- Visual status indicators: "Pending Your Review" | "Awaiting Their Approval" | "Approved" | "Rejected"
- Document cannot proceed to signature until ALL redlines resolved (approved/rejected)
- Clear escalation path: rejected redlines can be revised and resubmitted

### Carrier Lifecycle Management
**Automated Account Management:**
- **Active Phase**: Full access during application process
- **Completion Phase**: 30-day download window after final signatures
- **Archive Phase**: Account automatically archived after 90 days
- **Manual Override**: Admins can extend or immediately archive
- **Data Retention**: Audit trail maintained for compliance (7 years)

### Team Member Assignment Rules
**Clear Boundaries:**
- Team members see only currently assigned carriers
- Assignment changes transfer all access (notifications, documents, status)
- Historical assignments remain in audit logs but not accessible
- Reassignment requires Admin approval to prevent conflicts

### Admin Authority Structure
**Hierarchical Permissions:**
- **Owner**: Can add/remove Admins and override any Admin decision
- **Admins**: Cannot add other Admins, but can add Team Members
- **Admin Consensus**: Any Admin can approve carrier redlines (no multiple approval required)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Owner has final authority on disputed redlines

### Document State Management
**Workflow Integrity:**
- Documents have clear states: Draft | Under Review | Pending Approval | Signed | Archived
- State transitions require appropriate permissions (Admin approval for progression)
- Abandoned processes auto-escalate to Admin after 7 days of inactivity
- Version control maintains complete change history for legal compliance
