## Problem/Solution Section
### 🎯 THE TELECOM ONBOARDING NIGHTMARE

**Large Text Problem Statement:**
# 15+ emails. 6 document versions. 3 weeks later... still no signature.

Sound familiar? Sales teams, operators, and executives in telecom waste **40+ hours per month** wrangling:
- ❌ KYC forms buried in email attachments  
- ❌ MSAs with conflicting redlines across versions
- ❌ Missing required fields that stall approvals
- ❌ Carriers asking "what's next?" while deals go cold
- ❌ No visibility into where bottlenecks actually occur

### ✅ TELODOX FIXES THAT

**The Complete Telecom Onboarding Solution:**

🏗️ **Build Once, Use Forever**  
Upload your PDFs or build forms from scratch. Set required fields so nothing gets missed.

📋 **Smart Document Flow**  
KYC → FUSF → MSA → Interop Agreement. Next doc only appears when the previous one's approved.

✏️ **Built-in Redlining**  
Track changes with full version control. No more "which document is current?"

💬 **Real-time Collaboration**  
In-app chat and notifications when action is needed. Stop playing email tag.

🌐 **Your Branded Portal**  
Custom subdomain (onboarding.yourcompany.com) that integrates seamlessly with your sales process.

📊 **Full Pipeline Visibility**  
See exactly where every deal stands. Identify bottlenecks before they kill momentum.

## Built for Telecom Section
### 💼 DESIGNED FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF TELECOM

**Large Statement:**
# Whether you're a fiber shop, VOIP carrier, or MVNO — Telodox speaks your language.

We understand telecom onboarding isn't just "sign a contract." It's navigating:
- **Regulatory requirements** (FUSF, USF, state filings)
- **Technical specifications** (interconnection agreements, routing tables)
- **Financial qualifications** (credit checks, deposits, rate sheets)
- **Operational readiness** (NOC contacts, escalation procedures)

**Zero technical experience required.** Just plug in your documents and go.
