3. "How much time does your team spend following up on documents?"
4. "Have you lost deals because the onboarding process took too long?"

### Objection Handling
- **"We already use DocuSign"**: "DocuSign is great for signatures, but it doesn't handle the sequential workflows, form collection, and approval gates specific to telecom onboarding."
- **"It's too expensive"**: "How much revenue do you lose when a deal takes 3 weeks instead of 1 week to close? Telodox pays for itself with just one accelerated deal."
- **"We have a process that works"**: "If your process involves 15+ emails and manual tracking, you're leaving money on the table. Our customers see 40% more deals close."
